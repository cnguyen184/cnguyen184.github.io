**Projects**
**Cat Collector** 

**_Description_**

The mobile application for which we are developing a prototype is an Android augmented reality 
cat collecting game directed at the casual game market in an effort to expand society's recognition of 
AR technology in a fun, informal environment. As a general reference, our application is a variant of the popular mobile game - Pokemon Go

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/cnguyen184/cnguyen184.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
